# Introduction
On the 23rd of September,2022 I started the Zuri training cohort II as a Fullstack (Frontend and Python) development trainee. This repo consists of my week 3 to 5 projects during the training. 

## Projects

### Week 4

#### Pip, Virtual environments and intro to Django (python) Project 

Create a new Django project named “songcrud” and create an app in the project called “musicapp”. Your project must contain a requirements.txt file housing all the pinned dependencies from your project. Push the project to GitHub and submit your public GitHub repository link.

Note: Always create a virtual environment anytime you're working on a new Django project. You can get your requirements.txt file from your virtual environment
